    "A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a hybrid business structure introduced in India through the LLP Act, 2008. It combines the operational flexibility of a partnership with the benefits of limited liability offered by a company. An LLP exists as a separate legal entity, distinct from its partners, and is ideally suited for small and medium-sized businesses, professionals, and startups looking for a low-compliance, scalable, and liability-protected structure.",
    "LLPs offer limited liability protection, flexible internal management through an LLP Agreement, and no restriction on the number of partners (minimum 2 required). Moreover, LLPs are not required to maintain complex compliance like companies and can be formed with relatively low cost and ease.",
    "Taxbizlegal.com is a trusted platform that provides end-to-end services for Limited Liability Partnership Company registration, including incorporation, compliance, advisory, and consultancy.
