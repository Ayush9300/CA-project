      "A Private Limited Company (PLC) in India is one of the most popular and simplest forms of company registration. It offers limited liability and legal protection to its shareholders, making it an ideal choice for many entrepreneurs. Positioned as a hybrid entity between a partnership firm and a public company, it allows businesses to enjoy the benefits of both forms.",
      "To register a PLC, at least two individuals are required, and one individual can serve both as the director and shareholder. The liability of the company's members is confined to the value of their shares, providing protection for personal assets. Once the Certificate of Incorporation is received, the company can commence its operations. The entire registration process typically takes around 15 working days to complete.",
